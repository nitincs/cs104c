Description:

Ruth and Bleminda are playing a game with their rock collections. Each person
owns a set of rocks. The game works as follows: each person chooses a rock from
their collection and places it on the table. The person with the smaller rock
has their rock captured. This continues until both players have used all their
rocks. A rock may not be used in more than one round.

Bleminda spent hours figuring out the optimal order to play her rocks, but
accidentally lost her ordered list of moves. Ruth found Bleminda's moves and
wants to minimize the sum of her captured pieces.

Rules:

The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
T test cases follow.

Each test case begins with an integer N, the number of rocks that Ruth and
Bleminda have respectively. The next line contains N space separated integers,
the weights of Ruth's rocks. The line after that contains N space separated
integers, the weights of Bleminda's rocks. The weights of Bleminda's rocks are
given in the order they will be played.

Output:

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer: the
minimum amount of weight that is captured from Ruth.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 25
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= weight of a rock <= 10^9

Input (read from standard in):
2
3
2 5 1
6 1 4
4
1 2 3 4
7 7 7 7

Output (print to standard out):
1
10

Explanation:

In the first game, Ruth should play the 1 against the 6, the 2 against the 1,
and the 5 against the 4. Only the 1 rock is captured then.  In the second game,
no matter what order Ruth plays her rocks, she will lose every single one. Her
rocks have a total weight of 10.
