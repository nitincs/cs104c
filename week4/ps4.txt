Description:

Arnav is setting up a meeting of programming contest writers. At the start of 
the meeting, every pair of contest writers shakes hands. Each handshake takes 
1 second.

He wants to get as many writers as possible to make the work on any individual
not as bad, but if there's too many people, then introductions take more time.
Furthermore, for every X people (rounded down), he has to waste k more seconds
finding a larger room.

Given an upper bound on the amount of time Arnav wants to spend on this, compute
the maximum number of authors that Arnav can invite.

HINT: The number of handshakes in a group of n people is n * (n - 1) / 2.

Rules:

Each input file will begin with a number T, the number of test cases.

Each test case will consist of three space separated numbers $N X K$, the
maximum amount of time Arnav wants to spend on handshakes and room finding, the
intervals at which Arnav needs to find larger rooms, and how much extra time it
takes for him to find larger rooms.

Output:

Print out the maximum number of people that Arnav can invite.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^18
1 <= X <= 10^9
0 <= K <= 10^9
K * N <= 10^18
